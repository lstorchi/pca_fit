- basic pca fitting methods. Here  you  find  the  rootfile  reader 
  as well as the generatepca constants code and the code performing 
  the fitting.

- IMPORTANT NOTE: This is just a test code for internal  use  only, 
  nothing more than a basic rapid quick and dirty prototyping (i.e.
  the code should be totally restructured in a proper  OO  fashion)

- reminder : rel_0_4_0 need to be fixed but so far is the last  tag 
  before starting revision, removing several options (as the one to 
  use a single parameter at time, the one to fit also d0 or  x0  in
  both planes)
